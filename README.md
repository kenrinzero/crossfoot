# Crossfoot

An arithmetic-reconciled corpus of public statistical tables: each messy
PDF/HTML table is transcribed into a typed `.cells.json` whose own internal
arithmetic — row totals, subtotals, percent closures, balance identities —
must **reconcile exactly** under `reconcile.py`. The source's redundancy is
the proof: a transcription typo almost always breaks a cross-foot, so
correctness is derived, not trusted.

## Status

Active corpus (2026-07-19): schema + oracle frozen and live (**10/10 tests**;
strict coverage is the default), six public-source families vendored, and
**250 transcription units shipped**. Census P60-282 appendix tables A-1..A-7
and B-1..B-5 are complete under the frozen relation vocabulary. Unit **#250**
awaits its required different-agent audit before #251 ships.


## How a unit works

```bash
uv venv && uv sync              # once
# read BACKLOG.md -> open sources/<family>/<file> -> write
#   tables/<family>/<table-id>.cells.json  (cells + relations)
uv run python reconcile.py tables/<family>/<table-id>.cells.json
uv run pytest                   # harness self-tests stay green
```

Green + zero coverage warnings + ≥ the manifest's minimum relations = done.
Values are decimal strings (Decimal math — never floats); every total must
be targeted by a relation and every leaf must feed one.
