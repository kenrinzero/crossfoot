# Crossfoot

An arithmetic-reconciled corpus of public statistical tables: each messy
PDF/HTML table is transcribed into a typed `.cells.json` whose own internal
arithmetic — row totals, subtotals, percent closures, balance identities —
must **reconcile exactly** under `reconcile.py`. The source's redundancy is
the proof: a transcription typo almost always breaks a cross-foot, so
correctness is derived, not trusted.

## Status

Stage-0 seed (2026-07-07): schema + oracle frozen and live (13 self-tests
green; the oracle provably bites a single-cell typo and flags
under-declared coverage), three genuinely-messy sources vendored (Treasury
MTS May 2026, Apple FY2023 balance sheet from EDGAR, Census P60-282), and
three starter units named in `BACKLOG.md`. **No transcriptions yet.**

## How a unit works

```bash
uv venv && uv sync              # once
# read BACKLOG.md -> open sources/<family>/<file> -> write
#   tables/<family>/<table-id>.cells.json  (cells + relations)
uv run python reconcile.py tables/<family>/<table-id>.cells.json
uv run pytest                   # harness self-tests stay green
```

Green + zero coverage warnings + ≥ the manifest's minimum relations = done.
Values are decimal strings (Decimal math — never floats); every total must
be targeted by a relation and every leaf must feed one.
