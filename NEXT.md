# NEXT — rolling dispatch queue

The routing view: the next few sessions, in suggested order, with
difficulty and harness needs. `BACKLOG.md` stays the unit manifest
(specs, caps, minimums); `DESIGN.md` the frozen contract. This file is
for deciding *who does what next*.

**Rolling rules:** take the topmost session that fits your harness; when
shipped, move its block to *Shipped* (bottom, newest first) and append
newly-visible sessions to the queue. Re-sequencing is allowed — note why.

**Difficulty labels — this repo says D, not T:** task difficulty is
written **D1/D2/D3**, mapping 1:1 to the CHARTER's fleet-wide T1/T2/T3
(D1 = needs real judgment, D2 = well-specified execution, D3 =
deterministic + instantly checkable). Renamed locally (Kenrin,
2026-07-13) because crossfoot's own docs use "Tier 1 / Tier 3 / Tier 4"
for project *stages* (strict-coverage flip / footnote pass / new
relation types), and the two axes collide. "Tier N" in this repo always
means a stage, never difficulty. If a stray "T2" survives in older
crossfoot text, read it as D2.

**Harness notes for transcribers:**
- Neither host has poppler; PDF units use `uv run --with pdfplumber` (text
  layer) + a pypdfium2 page render for visual verification. The MTS PDF's
  text layer emits `(cid:NN)` tokens — decode `chr(NN+29)`, then verify
  against the render (footnote markers glue onto values: see BACKLOG).
- PDF units therefore want a **vision-capable** agent (the render check is
  mandatory discipline, not decoration). The HTML unit (Apple) does not.
- The gate for every transcription: `uv run python reconcile.py <file>`
  GREEN with 0 warnings (strict coverage is now default), relations ≥ manifest
  minimum, `uv run pytest` still green, one new file only.

## Queue

### 1. treasury-mts/2026-05-receipts-detail — **D2** · local-only · vision needed (PDF)
Slice the remainder of Table 4 (~160 cells) into ≤120-cell units and ship
the first. Suggested cut (verify before trusting): the Employment &
General Retirement subtree is ~105 cells and self-contained (OASI/DI/HI
pyramids — dense sum structure). Add the slice rows to BACKLOG first.
**Why D2:** the slicing decision + footnote-marker hazards (BACKLOG)
demand judgment; pure transcription of a decided slice would be D3.

### 2. bls-cpi/relative-importance-2024-housing — **D2** · local-only · HTML
Transcribe the Housing slice from the vendored BLS relative importance
table (`sources/bls-cpi/relative-importance-2024.htm`). 54 rows × 2 columns
= 108 cells; dense sum structure (shelter + fuels/utilities + furnishings
subtotals all rolling up to Housing). Already sized and added to BACKLOG
starter units. **Why D2:** HTML transcription is well-specified; the
slicing decision was already made in the vendoring unit.

## Not yet sequenced

- treasury-mts/2026-05-outlays — Table 5 size/split decision, then units.
- fec/2024-presidential-general, omb/budget-appendix-slice — D1 (web)
  vendoring first.
- Spot-audit at unit 10 — **D3**, MUST be a different agent than the
  transcribers (DESIGN § 6), non-arithmetic checks → AUDITS.md.

## Shipped

- 2026-07-13 · bls-cpi/relative-importance-2024 vendoring (D1, Kimi Work) —
  Vendored `https://www.bls.gov/cpi/tables/relative-importance/2024.htm`
  via Kimi WebBridge (browser session; Akamai 403s curl and Windows TLS).
  Source saved to `sources/bls-cpi/relative-importance-2024.htm` (90,118
  bytes, sha256 `2de17050f2ada5de1eff78c03b3df7fe5550d5490b09be6a89e6aab1d802044d`).
  Content sanity: 1 table, 322 rows × 2 columns = ~644 numeric cells,
  "All items" = 100.000/100.000 confirmed. Sized manifest row added:
  Housing slice (108 cells) moved to starter units; remaining slices
  (Food/Apparel/Transportation/Medical/Recreation/Education/Other/
  Aggregates) stay queued with proposed split sizes.

- 2026-07-13 · tier1/strict-coverage-default (D2, harness) —
  Flipped `--strict-coverage` to default in `reconcile.py`; added
  `standalone waivers` column to BACKLOG.md manifest; all three shipped
  tables + fixtures pass strict coverage (mini-uncovered still RED under
  strict).

- 2026-07-13 · census-p60/2023-income-a1 (D2, Antigravity) —
  Households by Total Money Income (All Races slice); 88 cells, 8 sum
  relations (6 with non-default tol 0.1), 8 percent-closure relations (6
  with non-default tol 0.1); strict-coverage GREEN. Commit `9b99afa`.

- 2026-07-13 · sec-10k/aapl-fy2023-balance-sheet (D2, Codex) —
  Apple FY2023 Consolidated Balance Sheets; 58 cells, 18 exact relations,
  4 share-count standalones; strict-coverage GREEN. Commit `0d31947`.

- 2026-07-13 · treasury-mts/2026-05-receipts (D2, went to Claude Fable 5) —
  Table 4 major-classification slice; 87 cells, 42 relations, 11 tol-1
  with quoted rounding note; strict-coverage GREEN. Commit `069e687`.
  In hindsight D2 was right: the cid-font decode + slice decision needed
  judgment; future *decided* slices of the same PDF are D3-adjacent.
